# Source Codes for tutorial projects in [ChangLab](https://qbio.io)
- I had a great experience in [ChangLab](https://qbio.io) as an undergrad intern from Jan to Feb 2020!
- During the internship, I reproduced several figures in the paper [“LIN28A is a suppressor of ER-associated translation in embryonic stem cells”](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23102813/) by VN Kim et al.
- Each filename corresponds to the figure in the paper that is reproduced. For example, S2A.ipynb contains the source code that reproduced supplementary figure S2A in the paper.
